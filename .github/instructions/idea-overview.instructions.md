# Document structure

This document should give a high level overview of the project idea, including:

* Problem statement
* Proposed solution
* Key features
* Target audience
* Technology stack
* Potential challenges and risks
* Future enhancements

## Folder Structure
Each project idea should be organized in its own folder with the following structure:

```
short-project-name/
  README.md - Details the concept, design, and pitch.
  presentation/ - Holds presentation materials.
  diagrams/ - Contains PlantUML diagrams and visuals.
  assets/ - Includes images, videos, and other assets.
```

## Principles
* Self-contained folders for modularity and scalability.
* MVP approach to validate ideas quickly.
* User-centric design focusing on usability.
